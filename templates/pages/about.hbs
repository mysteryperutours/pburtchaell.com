I am a design and computer science student in the honors program at Loyola University New Orleans. Outside school, I work part-time as a front end web developer at [Peach](http://joinpeach.com). Before working at Peach and attending Loyola, I worked as a freelancer designer in New Orleans and attended the New Orleans Center for Creative Arts, also known as NOCCA. I graduated as a level four student from NOCCA in May 2014 and started at Loyola in August 2014.
