# pburtchaell.com [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/pburtchaell/pburtchaell.com.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/pburtchaell/pburtchaell.com) ![Dependencies](https://david-dm.org/pburtchaell/pburtchaell.com.png)

## Overview

My website, [pburtchaell.com](http://pburtchaell.com), is generated by Assemble, a JavaScript static website generator. WebPack is used to compile all JavaScript and CSS bundles. Gulp.js provides an express server with live-reload for development and automates deploying to Amazon Web Services S3.

## Getting Started

1. Install development tools: `npm install -g gulp eslint`
2. Instal dependencies and build site: `npm install`

## Development 

- Run server and watch files for changes: `npm start`
- Run tests: `npm test`
- List available tasks: `gulp help`

### Tools Used

- [gulp](http://gulpjs.com/): Workflow automation.
- [WebPack](http://webpack.github.io/): JavaScript and CSS module bundler.
- [Assemble](http://assemble.io): Static site generator.
- [ESLint](http://eslint.org/): Linting utility for ES6.
- [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/): Continuous integration service.

## Deployment 

Deployment to Amazon Web Services S3 is automated with gulp and configured in a `.aws.yml` file. To deploy to the staging bucket, set the node `process.env.AWS` variable to `staging`. To deploy to the master/production bucket, set the variable to `master`. 

To deploy to the *staging.pburtchaell.com* bucket:

```
AWS=staging gulp deploy
```

To deploy to the *pburtchaell.com* bucket:

```
AWS=master gulp deploy
```

Sample `.aws.yml` file:

```
key: <api-key>
secret: <api-secret>
master: 
  bucket: pburtchaell.com
  region: us-west-2
```
