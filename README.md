## Overview

My website serves as a (hopefully) helpful example of how to build a React application with React Router, Redux and WebPack.

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies and build site: `npm install`
2. Run server and watch files for changes: `npm start`

## Development

- Build: `npm run build`
- Run tests: `npm test`

### Stack

My stack is very similar to what I use on an every day basis when programming JavaScript for web applications. I prefer to keep things as simple, yet efficient as possible.

- [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/): Declarative render model

- [Immutable.js](https://github.com/facebook/immutable-js): Immutable data
- [Less](https://github.com/less/less.js)
- [WebPack](http://webpack.github.io/): Bundles JS, CSS, images and fonts
- [Babel](https://babeljs.io): Enables ES 2015 JavaScript
- [ESLint](http://eslint.org/)
- [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/)
- [Parse](http://parse.com): Free REST API for storing data
