I have uninstalled the Twitter app from my phone. 

It took me one entire day and three encounters with the “Are you sure you would like to uninstall Twitter?” dialogue box to do it, but yes I have.

In October of 2013, I had an issue with Facebook. I was spending too much meaningless time on it and for that reason, I uninstalled it. For a while, I missed my friend's statuses, but after a month I forgot all about my news feed. I have since reinstalled Facebook on my phone, but I have no need to scroll through the perfunctory status updates. By removing Facebook from my phone, I opened up much of my time and I believe I am significantly more productive as a result. At 9:45pm today I finally did the same for Twitter and I do not think I will regret it.

Twitter is easily my favorite social network. Since follow a small number of people, I can easily have meaningful interactions with friends and followers. It’s the perfect tool for me to stay in touch with people I care about and have precocious conversations about topics that interest me, but… honestly I spend way too much time on it. Taking a look at the data, I usually spend 12&ndash;13 hours _every week_ on Twitter. To put this in perspective: there are 168 hours in a week, subtract the 70 I spend sleeping, and you have 98 hours left. This means I spend around 12 percent of my time on Twitter. 

That is outrageous. 

There are better things I can be doing with that extra time. I can walk my dog, spend more time with Sarah, run an extra mile in the morning, or work on more projects; with 12 percent of my week free, I have the ability to do so much more.

Sadly, now that Twitter is uninstalled I &ndash;quite ridiculously&ndash; feel like I am missing something. Because Twitter has taken up 14 hours of my time each week for so long, removing it from the picture will leave part of my day feeling empty. I miss having Twitter on my phone and the quick access to conversations it provides, but in reality I will be better off without it. 12 percent of my week is now reopened and I plan to use it to my benefit.

Lastly, I am not deactivating my account and leaving Twitter. In fact, you probably found the link to this post in one of my Tweets. Instead, I am disconnecting Twitter's direct connection with me through my phone. When my schedules allows me to spend time on Twitter.com, life will be as usual. However, those times will be less and less. Starting this week, I hope to spend only 3 hours a week on Twitter &mdash;just enough time to check notifcations and lists each day. 

So farewell Twitter mobile; I expect not having access to you every minute of my life to be amazing.
