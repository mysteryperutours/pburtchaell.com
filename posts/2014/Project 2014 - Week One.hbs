I finally have some time to publish an introduction and w1/52 of my largest side-project for 2014: _Project 2014_!

Project 2014 is a daily challenge to make a 500x500px graphic in under fifteen to twenty minutes. At the end of the year, I hope to print the 365 designs that I make into my own book. In the meantime, I will share my progress each week here on my site as well as on both [Dribbble](http://dribbble.com/_pb) and [B&eacute;hance](http://behance.net/burtchaell).

I am taking this challenge because I want to become a better designer. I hope that these simple designs will serve as inspiration for larger and more important projects. Of course, I also hope to gain technical experience and become more adapt with the processes and programs I use. I can already tell after one week that this undertaking will be a very rewarding experience for me. We shall have to see where I am come the end of the year (only 347 more designs to go as of today)!

## w1/52 (Week One)
I recently read _Meme Wars_, a very interesting book written by the editor and magazine that started &amp; named the Occupy Wall Street movement. Meme Wars lays out the next steps in rethinking and remaking our world with a new economic paradigm. Even though it was a complete accident that I found this book at the library, I enjoyed it and I would definitely suggest that anyone interested in economics take the time to read it. Besides having an amazing layout, the ideas this book presents are interesting and influential.
