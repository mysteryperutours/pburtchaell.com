_Project 2014 is a daily challenge to make a 500x500px graphic in under fifteen to twenty minutes. At the end of the year, I hope to print the 365 designs that I make into my own book. In the meantime, I will share my progress each week here on my site as well as on both [Dribbble]({{author.dribbble}}) and [B&eacute;hance]({{author.behance}})._

## w2/52
In order to push my creativity for w2/52, I focused on using shape and color over than type. Most of my designs are very heavy in typography so I knew it would be slightly difficult. I can not say the result is amazing, but it was definitely harder than usual to come up with original design ideas and well worth the challenge.

## w3/52
In July of last year I started wearing my first [Jawbone UP](http://jawbone.com/up/), a wristband that measures your sleep, steps, calories and workouts. Jawbone believes that users own their data completely and allows one to download &amp; use their data in creative ways. For w3/52, I visualized my very first month of data (July 27&ndash;August 27, 2013) using the graphs tool built into Illustrator. It was a good exercise to familiarize myself with a powerful tool I do not often use.
