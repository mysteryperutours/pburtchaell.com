My name is Patrick Burtchaell; I am a designer and a student from New Orleans, Louisiana. I have a passion for objectifying stories and ideas and working with the people who created with them. I make things for the web and for print and, when I have time, I [write](/) about design and technology.

As I am an alumnus of [New Orleans Center for Creative Arts](http://www.nocca.com) and currently a graphic design and computer science undergraduate student at Loyola University New Orleans. 

I work freelance when I can during the schoolyear, but especially during the summer; if you want, check out my [work](/work) page; open to working on projects of all sorts, I will fit it in however I can.

Most of the time, I am a pretty ordinary person. I say things on [Twitter]({{author.twitter}}). I post to [Dribbble]({{author.dribbble}}) and [B&eacute;hance]({{author.behance}}). My code ends up on [GitHub]({{author.github}}) most of the time.

The purpose of this website is be serve as an online repository for writings, documents, and work. The [colophon](/colophon) and [code styleguide](/styleguide) document the processess used to build it and the source can be found on [GitHub](http://github.com/pburtchaell/site).
