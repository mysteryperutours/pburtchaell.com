<a href=#time>
  <blockquote class=color-green>
    How long will it take for you to finish a project, and how soon can you get to work?
  </blockquote>
</a>

As every project has different requirements and features, every also project has a different timeline; in addition, I am a full-time college student. Thus, I can only work on a limited number of products at a time. Check my work page [for availability](/work). If you absolutely need something done immediately, I can either try to fit it in my schedule or I can refer you to an alternative web designer or agency.

<a href=#pricing>
  <blockquote class=color-blue>
    How does pricing work for a website?
  </blockquote>
</a>

Every website project starts at a base price of {{prices.website.base}} USD. Other variables, such as feature requirements and project timeline, will increase the price. For this base price you can expect a well developed and designed static site with a small number of pages. If you, for example, wanted the base site package, but powered by a content-management-system, the price would increase by $200.

<a href=#code>
  <blockquote class=color-red>
    I am a developer and I want to know more about the tools and processes you use.
  </blockquote>
</a>

First, I would suggest heading over to my [GitHub]({{author.github}}); secondly, checkout the [colophon](/colophon) and [source code]({{author.github}}/site) for this website. To give developers a better idea of my code style, I also have an HTML and CSS [styleguide](/styleguide).

The general rule of thumb is that I will always be on top of CSS and HTML specifications and browser support. If you still need to know more, or if you have any specific questions, ping me [on Twitter]({{author.twitter}}) or send me an email at <patrick@pburtchaell.com>.

<a href=#documentation>
  <blockquote class=color-green>
    Can I view an example contract, cover letter, and design brief?
  </blockquote>
</a>

You most certianly can. I have a copy of my contact and other project documents available [on GitHub]({{author.github}}/contract). Keep in mind, however, that these are simply sample documents and the final contract for every project can be modified to fit the project's uinque requirements.

<a href=#speaking>
  <blockquote class=color-blue>
    Do you speak at conferences and meetups?
  </blockquote>
</a>

I have never had the oppurtunity to speak at a conference related to the web design industry, but I do speak about technology, design, and development at the meetups and events around New Orleans; you can find an archive of those talks [on GitHub]({{author.github}}/talks).

If you would like me to speak at your conference, send an email to <patrick@pburtchaell.com> &mdash;there is about a 99.999 percent chance I will be excited.

<a href=#what-makes-you-qualified>
  <blockquote class=color-red>
    You said you are a student; what makes you qualified then?
  </blockquote>
</a>

During highschool, I attended the New Orleans Center for Creative Arts (NOCCA), a unique arts conservatory in the Bywater neighborhood of New Orleans, about five minutes away from the French Quarter. For four years &mdash;2010&ndash;2014&mdash I studied Media Arts under the instruction of professional artists and with a class of about ten other students. My work at NOCCA has not only taught me artistry in filmmmaking, design, computer science and audio engineering, it also taught me professionalism and provided me with a college-like atmosphere to learn.

At the end of their high-school carreers, many NOCCA students leave the school with handsome scholarships to prestigous schools &mdash; others leave the school to enter directly into the industry. Four of my fellow seniors left the school with $20,000 scholarships and I left with a full-ride to the Loyola University New Orleans graphic design program, where I am currently attending.
