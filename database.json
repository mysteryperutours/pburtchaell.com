We are currently working together to develop  our ideas for products, games and applications. In May 2015, I designed the company website and branding. The goal of both the branding and the website was to relfect the happy and playful nature of the company without breaking the rational & classical design principles I often embrace in my work. We are a company that does great work and is certainly not afraid to have fun at the same time."
