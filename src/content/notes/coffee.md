## Coffee in New Orleans, LA

Avoid chains like PJ's Coffee, Starbucks, etc. There's better options in New Orleans.

These are my favorites:

- [Mojo Coffee House](https://www.yelp.com/biz/mojo-coffee-house-new-orleans) (Uptown and Garden District)
- [Cherry Espresso Bar](https://www.yelp.com/biz/cherry-espresso-bar-new-orleans-2) (Uptown)
- [French Truck Coffee](https://www.yelp.com/biz/french-truck-coffee-new-orleans) (Uptown and Garden District)
- [Fair Grids Coffee House](https://www.yelp.com/biz/fair-grinds-coffee-house-new-orleans) (Mid City)

These are some other places that aren't as good, but worth a stop:

- [The Orange Couch](https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-orange-couch-new-orleans) (Bywater)
- [Church Alley Coffee](https://www.yelp.com/biz/church-alley-coffee-bar-new-orleans) (Mid City)
- [Z'otz](https://www.yelp.com/biz/zotz-new-orleans) (Uptown)
- [Hey Cafe and Coffee Roastery](https://www.yelp.com/biz/hey-caf%C3%A9-and-coffee-roastery-new-orleans-3) (Uptown)
- [Rue de la Course Coffehouse](https://www.yelp.com/biz/cherry-espresso-bar-new-orleans-2) (Uptown)
