Segment is a social network concept created to explore new ways we can share content with others. Most social networks are based on people: following or friending people and engaging with content from people we follow. In Segment, we explore how a social network would work if people followed feeds of content instead of following people.

We call these feed of content Segments and they represent the many segments of interests that people have in life. A person might have one Segment for their interests in Camping and another Segment for Technology. Segments can tell stories too, like if you create one for your Trip to Alaska. If you want a Segment for just your best friends, it can be a private Segment that no one can see or join without an invite.
