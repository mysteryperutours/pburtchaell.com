We call these feed of content Segments and they represent the many segments of interests that people have in life. A person might have one Segment for their interests in Camping and another Segment for Technology. Segments can tell stories too, like if you create one for your Trip to Alaska. If you want a Segment for just your best friends, it can be a private Segment that no one can see or join without an invite.
