The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP)--known to most people as food stamps--is a welfare program available in Louisiana and administered by the United States Department of Agriculture. The program, which provides food assistance to people in poverty, is integral to supporting the livelihood and wellness of people not just in Louisiana, but in all of America.

## The Problem

> "[The process of applying for food stamps] is very redundant. It just felt like I was filling out the same information over and over and over again." [(Chronister et al. 2016:6)][chronister]

It's difficult for people to apply for and access welfare assistance in Louisiana--SNAP is no exception. In general, the experience for SNAP applicants is negative, costing them significant time and creating emotional distress.

Unwelcoming websites frustrate people with countless accessibility and usability problems. There is too much information online, overwhelming people and creating a general feeling of anxiety. With phrases like "165% Maximum Income Limits", the criteria for eligibility are not clear. Forms are redundant, difficult to access and poorly translated to foreign languages. Some people describe the application process as throwing information into a black hole, as they were left waiting for weeks, wondering about the status of their application.

These issues--which are not only present for SNAP, but for other welfare programs--manifest in one simple number: 26.9 million children were eligible for SNAP in the year 2013, but did not receive assistance. I would argue the negative user experience of applying for SNAP is a large part of this problem.

## Research Question

My research question, "How can the user experience of applying for SNAP in Louisiana be improved?", looks at how the problems I mentioned can be improved through the lens of design thinking.

## The Goal

Given the research outcomes and design artifacts, the goal of this project is to demonstrate how Louisiana can improve the experience of applying for SNAP in Louisiana through design and design research. I hope this research can help product teams, policymakers, and other stakeholders in government services design experiences that help people more equitably and easily apply for food assistance.

With better application experience, assistance will reach the children and families that need it, bettering their wellbeing and securing food for their meals. Aside from providing a better way of life for people, there's significant impact on the economy. For every five dollars spent on SNAP assistance, eight dollars is stimulated in the economy. [(Kirlin 2017)][kirklin]

## Literature Review

Within academia, the literature suggests expanding policy, spending more smartly, and cutting red tape are opportunities to improve access to SNAP and other programs in the safety social net. In general, policy is important to improving access and usability because it dictates what must be accomplished by SNAP and influences the strategy of the touch points built by the program.

### Extend Section 504 and Section 508

With regard to better policy, regulations to extend Section 504 and Section 508 of the American Rehabilitation Act would provide greater protection and increased accessibility for vulnerable populations with physical impairments such as blindness or deafness. [(Lyles et al. 2017)][lyles]

### Spend funds smarter

Spending funds smarter—with more money directed to research, design and technology—can create better designed products and a better application process. [(Lower-Basch 2017:22)][lower-basch]

### People are challenged by access, literacy and fluency

Research shows three primary variables challenge people who interact with the government. People are challenged by digital access, which is defined by the devices a person owns, the access to the internet they have, and the reliability of the systems (e.g., the website or the office).

Second, they are challenged by digital literacy, which is defined by the tasks someone can perform on the internet (e.g., email, social media, Google) and the tasks someone can perform on their device (e.g., settings, updates, software). Finally, people are challenged by English language fluency.

### People rely on others for help

According to the Federal Front Door report [(Chronister et al. 2017:8)][chronister], people depend on others--a family member, a friend, the local librarian, or some other proxy in their social network--for help with touch points. The person providing assistance becomes a proxy. Applicants rely on proxies because touch points are not designed to provide ease-of-use or assistance—instead touch points are complex and redundant. As I said in the introduction, the literature also shows people weigh the benefit of a government service with the effort—and time cost of—applying for it. If the cost is too high, then they forgo the application process and any the potential benefits. (Ibid.) 

With regard to English language fluency, non-English speakers find government services incomplete or inaccurate, and again rely on proxies. (Ibid. 13) However, the reliance on a proxy breaks down if someone’s social network is limited—if they do not have access to the friend or to the librarian for help. If their network is limited, they fall through the cracks and forgo the application process.

### People need realtime feedback

In 2017, Nava partnered with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services and Code for America to research how people use the Healthcare.gov website. Researchers at Nava searched for opportunities for "dramatic gains in the quality of the social safety net". [(Gaudet 2017)][gaudet]

Speed, they found, is an important opportunity for improvement, saying, "[experiences] can vary wildly, with some of the most vulnerable residents, like immigrants and the very sick, reporting a cumbersome, slow experience." [(Ibid.)][gaudet]

In 2016, for a of study the Medicaid and SNAP benefit application processes, USDS found that people feel they are tossing paperwork into a black hole, waiting endlessly for a response from the government. [(Comeaux 2016:29)][comeaux] When touch points provide real-time feedback on if the applicant is or is not likely to receive a benefit, people will follow through with the application/enrollment process and feel they are not wasting time with paperwork. 

### People need touch point options

USDS also found that people need a variety of different touch points. Some people will prefer online touch points, others will prefer phone numbers, and some will prefer in-person government agents at an office. [(Ibid. 30)][comeaux]
