Daily Weather is a permanent home for weather on Facebook for both iOS and Android. Previously, weather forecasts were available on Facebook in a promotional unit in the news feed, but this forecast was not permanent and did not provide enough information.

I introduced a system for detailed weather forecasts that people can access every day, at any time. My final deliverable included a home for weather where people can opt into forecast notifications, share the forecast with friends and check the weather in other locations.

Every day, daily weather on Facebook helps millions of people find the information they want in a fast and delightful experience that's unique to Facebook.
