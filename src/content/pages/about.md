Originally from the grand city of New Orleans, I currently work as a Product Designer at [Facebook](https://facebook.com) in California. Previously, I worked at companies like [Revelry Labs](https://revelry.co/) and [Gigster](https://gigster.com/).

> Technology should work for and with people, creating a connected world that is better for everyone. 

My background is in design and computer science. Interested in the entire product design process, I start with the most basic problem or idea and develop it from wireframes to prototypes. With experience in software engineering as well as design, I sometimes become directly involved in writing and reviewing code.

## Open Source

I have a special spot in my heart for [React](https://github.com/facebook/react) and [Redux](https://github.com/reduxjs/redux), open source JavaScript libraries I have utilized since 2014 and 2015, respectively. I actively maintain and contribute to open source projects on GitHub.
